# What are hooks?

```notes
Add image to this slide?

Give an overview of what Hooks are.

A hook is a special function that lets you "hook into" React features. Previously if you wrote a pure js function or function component
a term the react core team coined, and needed to add state you would convert the component to a class.
Now you can use hooks instead.
```

<CodeSurfer 
  code={require("raw-loader!./snippets/hooks.snippet")} 
  lang="javascript"
  showNumbers={true}
  dark={true}
    steps={[
    { notes: "useState allows you to use state in a function component"},
    { tokens: {4: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]}, notes: "the convention is a variable name and set + (same variable name)" },
    { tokens: {4: [11, 12, 13, 14, 15]}, notes: "0 is the initial value" },
    { range: [5, 6], notes: "increment adds 1 and reset resets the value back to 0" },    
    { range: [15, 15] , notes: "Notice we aren't using this.state.count" }
  ]}
  />;

```notes
useState returns a stateful value, and a function to update it In this example count is the stateful value and useCount
is the function to update this value. Function component is a term react coined, which means it is literally a js function.

The square brackets aren't specific to react, but this is an example of array destructuring, whihc means we are making 2 variables count and setCount.

Inside a function component you don't have access to this.

Opinion
This looks cleaner than this.state all over the place.

# Summary of Hooks

<div style={{ fontSize: 40, textAlign: "left" }}>
  <ul>
    <li>Code is more readable.</li>
    <li>Easier to test.</li>
    <li>Faster in Prod(In Theory).</li>
    <li>???</li>
    <li>???</li>
  </ul>
</div>

```notes
1) Your code is more readable, because hooks allow us to break out our logic more cleanly and concisely.
2) One of the side benefits of smaller components is it is a lot easier to test.
3) Hooks are better optimez for minification, which in theory should reduce the bundle size and make it a little more performant.
Last Point) Tell story about what we are doing with our project at work. (Refactoring certain areas ... hitting the growing pains).
If your at that point with your app use hooks when you refactor, but I wouldn't refactor an app just to use hooks.
